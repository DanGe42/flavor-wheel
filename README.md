## Setup

Prerequisites: Node >= 6

`yarn install` (or `npm install`)

To build the minified bundle, run `npm run build`.

### Development server

1. `npm run webpack:dev`
2. Point your browser to http://localhost:8080/demo.html

This setup runs via webpack-dev-server, so any changes you make to JavaScript
or SCSS assets will trigger a browser refresh.
